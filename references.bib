   abstract = {We provide a detailed exposition of our computational framework designed for the accurate calculation of real-frequency dynamical correlation functions of the single-impurity Anderson model in the regime of weak to intermediate coupling. Using quantum field theory within the Keldysh formalism to directly access the self-energy and dynamical susceptibilities in real frequencies, as detailed in our recent publication [Ge et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 115128 (2024)], the primary computational challenge is the full three-dimensional real-frequency dependence of the four-point vertex. Our codebase provides a fully MPI+OpenMP parallelized implementation of the functional renormalization group (fRG) and the self-consistent parquet equations within the parquet approximation. It leverages vectorization to handle the additional complexity imposed by the Keldysh formalism, using optimized data structures and highly performant integration routines. Going beyond the results shown in the previous publication, the code includes functionality to perform fRG calculations in the multiloop framework, up to arbitrary loop order, including self-consistent self-energy iterations. Moreover, implementations of various regulators, such as hybridization, interaction, frequency, and temperature, are supplied.},

   abstract = {In the last decades, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and its diagrammatic extensions have been successfully applied to describe local and nonlocal correlation effects in correlated electron systems. Unfortunately, except for the exact solution, it is impossible to fulfill both the Pauli principle and conservation laws at the same time. Consequently, fundamental observables such as the kinetic and potential energies are ambiguously defined. In this work, we propose an approach to overcome the ambiguity in the calculation of the potential energy within the ladder dynamical vertex approximation (DΓA) by introducing an effective mass renormalization parameter in both the charge and the spin susceptibility of the system. We then apply our method to the half-filled single-band Hubbard model on a three-dimensional bipartite cubic lattice. We find (i) at weak-to-intermediate coupling, a reasonable modification of the transition temperature TN to the antiferromagnetically ordered state with respect to previous ladder DΓA calculations without charge renormalization. This is in good agreement with dual fermion and Monte Carlo results; (ii) the renormalization of charge fluctuations in our new approach leads to a unique value for the potential energy which is substantially lower than corresponding ones from DMFT and non-self-consistent ladder DΓA; and (iii) the hierarchy of the kinetic energies between the DMFT and the ladder DΓA in the weak coupling regime is restored by the consideration of charge renormalization.},

   abstract = {In this article we review essential natures of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) from a universal point of view. First we summarize experimental results on SCES by focusing on typical materials such as cuprates, BEDT-TTF organic superconductors, and ruthenate Sr2RuO4. Experimental results on other important SCES, heavy-fermion systems, will be reviewed separately. The formalism to discuss superconducting properties of SCES is shown based on the Dyson-Gor'kov equations. Here two typical methods to evaluate the vertex function are introduced: One is the perturbation calculation up to the third-order terms with respect to electron correlation. Another is the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) method based on the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. The results obtained by the FLEX method are in good agreement with those obtained by the perturbation calculation. In fact, a reasonable value of Tc for spin-singlet d-wave superconductivity is successfully reproduced by using both methods for SCES such as cuprates and BEDT-TTF organic superconductors. As for Sr2RuO 4 exhibiting spin-triplet superconductivity, it is quite difficult to describe the superconducting transition by using the FLEX calculation. However, the superconductivity can be naturally explained by the perturbation calculation, since the third-order terms in the anomalous self-energy play the essential role to realize the triplet superconductivity. Another important purpose of this article is to review anomalous electronic properties of SCES near the Mott transition, since the nature of the normal state in SCES has been one of main issues to be discussed. Especially, we focus on pseudogap phenomena observed in under-doped cuprates and organic superconductors. A variety of scenarios to explain the pseudogap phenomena based on the superconducting and/or spin fluctuations are critically reviewed and examined in comparison with experimental results. According to the recent theory, superconducting fluctuations, inherent in the quasi-two-dimensional and strong-coupling superconductors, are the origin of the pseudogap formation. In these compounds, superconducting fluctuations induce a kind of resonance between the Fermi-liquid quasi-particle and the Cooper-pairing states. This resonance gives rise to a large damping effect of quasi-particles and reduces the spectral weight near the Fermi energy. We discuss the magnetic and transport properties as well as the single-particle spectra in the pseudogap state by the microscopic theory of the superconducting fluctuations. As for heavy-fermion superconductors, experimental results are reviewed and several theoretical analyses on the mechanism are provided based on the same viewpoint as explained above. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It reconciles in particular the occurrence of a two-component order parameter with the presence of line nodes of quasiparticles along the c axis in the superconducting phase. The strong angular dependence of the gap along the Fermi surface is in stark contrast to its quasilocality when expressed in the orbital basis.

The interaction between electrons through Hund's coupling promotes both the intraorbital dxz(yz) and the interorbital magnetic susceptibility. As a consequence, the leading pairing channel, conventional s+-, acquires sizable interorbital dxy-dxz(yz) singlet pairing with odd parity under glide-plane symmetry.

The recently developed dynamical vertex approximation is a state-of-the-art technique that has quantitatively predicted the superconducting dome of nickelates. Here, we apply it to study the effect of pressure in the infinite-layer nickelate SrxPr1−xNiO2. We reproduce the increase of the critical temperature (Tc) under pressure found in experiment up to 12 GPa. According to our results, Tc can be further increased with higher pressures. Even without Sr-doping the parent compound, PrNiO2, will become a high-temperature superconductor thanks to a strongly enhanced self-doping of the Ni $$\{d\}_\{\{x\}^\{2\}-\{y\}^\{2\}\}$$ orbital under pressure. With a maximal Tc of 100 K around 100 GPa, nickelate superconductors can reach that of the best cuprates. The authors theoretically study the pressure dependence of the phase diagram of the nickelate PrNiO2 with and without Sr doping. At high pressure, they find that the superconducting dome is significantly enhanced in both Tc and doping-range of superconductivity compared with ambient pressure, with a maximal Tc of 100 K around 100 GPa in absence of external doping.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how nonlocal correlations affect, selectively, the physics of correlated electrons over different energy scales, from the Fermi level to the band edges. This goal is achieved by applying a diagrammatic extension of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), the dynamical vertex approximation (DΓA), to study several spectral and thermodynamic properties of the unfrustrated Hubbard model in two and three dimensions. Specifically, we focus first on the low-energy regime by computing the electronic scattering rate and the quasiparticle mass renormalization for decreasing temperatures at a fixed interaction strength. This way, we obtain a precise characterization of the several steps through which the Fermi-liquid physics is progressively destroyed by nonlocal correlations. Our study is then extended to a broader energy range, by analyzing the temperature behavior of the kinetic and potential energy, as well as of the corresponding energy distribution functions. Our findings allow us to identify a smooth but definite evolution of the nature of nonlocal correlations by increasing interaction: They either increase or decrease the kinetic energy w.r.t. DMFT depending on the interaction strength being weak or strong, respectively. This reflects the corresponding evolution of the ground state from a nesting-driven (Slater) to a superexchange-driven (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet (AF), whose fingerprints are, thus, recognizable in the spatial correlations of the paramagnetic phase. Finally, a critical analysis of our numerical results of the potential energy at the largest interaction allows us to identify possible procedures to improve the ladder-based algorithms adopted in the dynamical vertex approximation.},

Even in the presence of the Hubbard subbands, the origin of the pseudogap at weak-to-intermediate coupling is in the splitting of the quasiparticle peak. At stronger coupling (closer to the insulating phase) the splitting of Hubbard subbands is expected instead. The k dependence of the self-energy appears to be also much more pronounced in two dimensions as can be observed in the k -resolved DΓA spectra, experimentally accessible by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy in layered correlated systems. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The Hubbard model represents the fundamental model for interacting quantum systems and electronic correlations. Using the two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model at weak coupling as a testing ground, we perform a comparative study of a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art quantum many-body methods. Upon cooling into its insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, the model hosts a rich sequence of distinct physical regimes with crossovers between a high-temperature incoherent regime, an intermediate-temperature metallic regime, and a low-temperature insulating regime with a pseudogap created by antiferromagnetic fluctuations. We assess the ability of each method to properly address these physical regimes and crossovers through the computation of several observables probing both quasiparticle properties and magnetic correlations, with two numerically exact methods (diagrammatic and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo methods) serving as a benchmark. By combining computational results and analytical insights, we elucidate the nature and role of spin fluctuations in each of these regimes. Based on this analysis, we explain how quasiparticles can coexist with increasingly long-range antiferromagnetic correlations and why dynamical mean-field theory is found to provide a remarkably accurate approximation of local quantities in the metallic regime. We also critically discuss whether imaginary-time methods are able to capture the non-Fermi-liquid singularities of this fully nested system.},

   abstract = {We generalize the formalism of the dynamical vertex approximation (DΓA) - a diagrammatic extension of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) - to treat magnetically ordered phases. To this aim, we start by concisely illustrating the many-electron formalism for performing ladder resummations of Feynman diagrams in systems with broken SU(2) symmetry associated to ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AF) order. We then analyze the algorithmic simplifications introduced by taking the local approximation of the two-particle irreducible vertex functions in the Bethe-Salpeter equations, which defines the ladder implementation of DΓA for magnetic systems. The relation of this assumption with the DMFT limit of large coordination-number/high dimensions is explicitly discussed. As a last step, we derive the expression for the ladder DΓA self-energy in the FM- and AF-ordered phases of the Hubbard model. The physics emerging in the AF-ordered case is explicitly illustrated by means of approximated calculations based on a static mean-field input for DΓA equations. The results obtained capture fundamental aspects of both metallic and insulating ground states of two-dimensional antiferromagnets, providing a reliable compass for future, more extensive applications of our approach. Possible routes to further develop diagrammatic-based treatments of magnetic phases in correlated electron systems are briefly outlined in the Conclusions.},

As a minimal model, we identify the one-band Hubbard model for the Ni 3 (Formula presented.) orbital plus a pocket around the A-momentum. The latter, however, merely acts as a decoupled electron reservoir. This reservoir makes a careful translation from nominal Sr-doping to the doping of the one-band Hubbard model mandatory. Our dynamical mean-field theory calculations, in part already supported by the experiment, indicate that the Γ pocket, Nd 4f orbitals, oxygen 2p, and the other Ni 3d orbitals are not relevant in the superconducting doping regime. The physics is completely different if topotactic hydrogen is present or the oxygen reduction is incomplete. Then, a two-band physics hosted by the Ni 3 (Formula presented.) and 3 (Formula presented.) orbitals emerges. Based on our minimal modeling, we calculated the superconducting Tc vs. Sr-doping x phase diagram prior to the experiment using the dynamical vertex approximation. For such a notoriously difficult to determine quantity as Tc, the agreement with the experiment is astonishingly good. The prediction that Tc is enhanced with pressure or compressive strain has been confirmed experimentally as well. This supports that the one-band Hubbard model plus an electron reservoir is the appropriate minimal model.},

In this way, we could distinguish the situations where the multiple divergences simply reflect the emergence of an underlying, single energy scale ν∗ below which perturbation theory is no longer applicable, from those where the breakdown of perturbation theory affects, not trivially, different energy regimes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on the theoretical understanding of the nonperturbative physics around the MIT and for future developments of many-body algorithms applicable in this regime.},

We find large differences in the electronic correlations in the PPP model compared to a Hubbard model with only local interactions. The quasiparticle renormalization (or mass enhancement) is much weaker in the PPP than in the Hubbard model, but the static part of the self-energy enhances the band gap of the former. Furthermore, the vertex corrections to the optical conductivity are much more important in the PPP model. Because nonlocal interactions strongly alter the self-energy, we conclude that the PA is more suitable for calculating conjugated π bonds in molecules than single site dynamical mean-field theory.},

   abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions f(k,k′). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme. © 1965 The American Physical Society.},

In extreme nonrelativistic approximation and to lowest order in g2 they reduce to the appropriate Schrödinger equation. One of these integral equations is applied to the deuteron ground state using scalar mesons of mass μ with scalar coupling. For neutral mesons the Lorentz-invariant interaction is transformed into the sum of the instantaneous Yukawa interaction and a retarded correction term. The value obtained for g2 differs only by a fraction proportional to (μM)2 from that obtained by using a phenomenological Yukawa potential. For a purely charged meson theory a correction term is obtained by a direct solution of the relativistic integral equation using only the first term in the expansion of the kernel. This correction is due to the fact that a nucleon can emit, or absorb, positive and negative mesons only alternately. The constant g2 is increased by a fraction of 1.1(μM) or 15 percent. © 1951 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {We present here two alternative schemes designed to correct the high-frequency truncation errors in the numerical treatment of the Bethe-Salpeter equations. The schemes are applicable to all Bethe-Salpeter calculations with a local two-particle irreducible vertex, which is relevant, e.g., for the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and its diagrammatic extensions. In particular, within a purely diagrammatic framework, we could extend existing algorithms for treating the static case in the particle-hole sector to more general procedures applicable to all bosonic frequencies and all channels. After illustrating the derivation and the theoretical interrelation of the two proposed schemes, these have been applied to the Bethe-Salpeter equations for the auxiliary Anderson impurity models of selected DMFT calculations, where results can be compared against a numerically "exact" solution. The successful performance of the proposed schemes suggests that their implementation can significantly improve the accuracy of DMFT calculations at the two-particle level, in particular for more realistic multiorbital calculations where the large number of degrees of freedom substantially restricts the actual frequency range for numerical calculations, as well as - on a broader perspective - of the diagrammatic extensions of DMFT.},

   abstract = {Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) has opened new perspectives for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems and greatly improved our understanding of correlation effects in models and materials. In contrast to Hartree-Fock-type approximations the mean field of DMFT is dynamical, whereby local quantum fluctuations are fully taken into account. DMFT becomes exact in the limit of high spatial dimensions or coordination number. Using DMFT the dynamics of correlated electron systems can be investigated non-perturbatively at all interaction strengths, electron densities and temperatures. By merging density functional theory with DMFT a powerful method for the calculation of the properties of correlated electron materials has become available, which is applicable to bulk systems and heterostructures, including topological states of matter. The inclusion of non-local correlations into DMFT makes it possible to explore unconventional superconductivity and the critical behavior at thermal or quantum phase transitions. By generalizing DMFT to non-equilibrium states also the real-time dynamics of correlated systems can be investigated. In this brief review the foundations and current status of DMFT are discussed along with characteristic physical insights obtained with this approach.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {A boundary condition at t= (t being the "relative" time variable) is obtained for the four-dimensional wave function of a two-body system in a bound state. It is shown that this condition implies that the wave function can be continued analytically to complex values of the "relative time" variable; similarly the wave function in momentum space can be continued analytically to complex values of the "relative energy" variable p0. In particular one is allowed to consider the wave function for purely imaginary values of t, or respectively p0, i.e., for real values of x4=ict and p4=ip0. A wave equation satisfied by this function is obtained by rotation of the integration path in the complex plane of the variable p0, and it is further shown that the formulation of the eigenvalue problem in terms of this equation presents several advantages in that many of the ordinary mathematical methods become available. In an especially simple case ("ladder approximation" equation for two spinless particles bound by a scalar field of zero rest mass) an integral representation method is presented which allows one to reduce the problem exactly (and for arbitrary values of the total energy of the bound state) to an eigenvalue problem of the Sturm-Liouville type.

   abstract = {In contrast to the mean field approximation of BCS theory, the Migdal-Eliashberg approach is a more sophisticated framework to describe phonon-mediated supercon- ductivity. Allowing strong coupling between electronic and bosonic fields opens the door to investigate the eects of inter-band processes on the superconducting state in a controllable setting. We derive and solve the Eliashberg equations for a two-band model, inspired by twisted graphene systems, finding an entirely band-o-diagonal superconducting order parameter. By including full momentum and Matsubara fre- quency dependence, we uncover a mixing of even- and odd-frequency states induced by the band splitting. As a result, the superconductor exhibits very unconventional spectral properties for electron-phonon pairing; this includes a region with a nodal spectrum and a region with finite gap, which is, however, much smaller than the order parameter magnitude. Our findings have consequences for recent experiments on the superconducting state in twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene.},

   abstract = {The superconducting state in vanadium characterizes with the critical temperature (Tc) equal to 5.3 K. The Coulomb pseudopotential, calculated with the help of the Eliashberg equations, possesses anomalously high value μ⋆(3Ωmax) = 0.259 or μ⋆(10Ωmax) = 0.368 (Ωmax denotes the maximum phonon frequency). Despite the relatively large electron-phonon coupling constant (λ = 0.91), the quantities such as the order parameter (Δ), the specific heat (C), and the thermodynamic critical field (Hc) determine the values of the dimensionless ratios not deviating much from the predictions of the BCS theory: RΔ = 2Δ(0)/kBTc = 3.68, RC = ΔC(Tc) /CN(Tc) = 1.69, and RH=TcCN(Tc)/Hc2(0)=0.171. This result is associated with the reduction of the strong-coupling and the retardation effects by the high value of the Coulomb pseudopotential. It has been shown that the results of the Eliashberg formalism can be relatively precisely reproduced with the help of the semi-analytical formulas, if the value of μ⋆ is determined on the basis of the Tc-Allen-Dynes expression (μAD⋆ = 0.198). The attention should be paid to the fact that in the numerical and in the semi-analytical approach the comparable values of the thermodynamic parameters for the same μ⋆ have been obtained only in the vicinity of the point μ⋆ = 0.1.},

Isostructural examples include bulk superconducting Sr2RuO4 (ref. 2) and surface-electron-doped Sr2IrO4, which exhibits spectroscopic signatures consistent with a superconducting gap3,4, although a zero-resistance state has not yet been observed. This approach has also led to the theoretical investigation of nickelates5,6, as well as thin-film heterostructures designed to host superconductivity. One such structure is the LaAlO3/LaNiO3 superlattice7–9, which has been recently proposed for the creation of an artificially layered nickelate heterostructure with a singly occupied dx2-y2 band. The absence of superconductivity observed in previous related experiments has been attributed, at least in part, to incomplete polarization of the eg orbitals10. Here we report the observation of superconductivity in an infinite-layer nickelate that is isostructural to infinite-layer copper oxides11–13. Using soft-chemistry topotactic reduction14–20, NdNiO2 and Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 single-crystal thin films are synthesized by reducing the perovskite precursor phase. Whereas NdNiO2 exhibits a resistive upturn at low temperature, measurements of the resistivity, critical current density and magnetic-field response of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 indicate a superconducting transition temperature of about 9 to 15 kelvin. Because this compound is a member of a series of reduced layered nickelate crystal structures21–23, these results suggest the possibility of a family of nickelate superconductors analogous to copper oxides24 and pnictides25.},

Here we review the finite temperature formulation of Eliashberg theory, both on the imaginary and real frequency axis, and briefly display some examples of the consequences of a dynamical, as opposed to static, interaction.

When crossing symmetry is not imposed, the convergence of both simple iteration and more complicated continuous loading (homotopy) methods is limited to high temperatures and weak interactions. We modify the algorithm to impose the crossing symmetry without increasing the computational complexity. We also imposed time reversal and a subset of the point group symmetries, but they did not further improve the convergence. We elaborate the details of the latency hiding scheme which can significantly improve the performance in the computational implementation. With these modifications, stable solutions for the parquet equations can be obtained by iteration more quickly even for values of the interaction that are a significant fraction of the bandwidth and for temperatures that are much smaller than the bandwidth.

Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

In Chapter 2, we derive a procedure to extract the so-called kernel functions from local two-particle Green's functions, an efficient parametrization of the high-frequency asymptotics of vertices, and demonstrate its usability by means of analytic calculations in the atomic limit. In Chapter 3, we present several results obtained by applying our new procedure to QMC data of both a one-band model system and an ab initio simulation of SrVO_3 with three bands.

We justify our implementation by accurately reproducing the dynamical mean-field theory results from momentum-independent parquet calculations. The high-frequency asymptotics of the single-particle self-energy and the two-particle vertex are correctly reproduced, which turns out to be essential for the self-consistent determination of the parquet solutions. The current implementation is also feasible for the dynamical vertex approximation.},

   abstract = {Vertex functions are a crucial ingredient of several forefront many-body algorithms in condensed matter physics. However, the full treatment of their frequency and momentum dependence severely restricts numerical calculations. A significant advancement requires an efficient treatment of the high-frequency asymptotic behavior of the vertex functions. In this work, we first provide a detailed diagrammatic analysis of the high-frequency structures and their physical interpretation. Based on these insights, we propose a parametrization scheme, which captures the whole high-frequency domain for arbitrary values of the Coulomb interaction and electronic density, and we discuss the details of its algorithmic implementation in many-body solvers based on parquet-equations as well as functional renormalization group schemes. Finally, we assess its validity by comparing our results for a single impurity Anderson model with exact diagonalization calculations. The proposed parametrization is pivotal for the algorithmic development of all quantum many-body methods based on vertex functions arising from both local and non-local static microscopic interactions as well as effective dynamic interactions which uniformly approach a static value for large frequencies. In this way, our present technique can substantially improve vertex-based diagrammatic approaches including spatial correlations beyond dynamical mean-field theory.},

   abstract = {We present wannier90, a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWF) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWF in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWF for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system. Wannier functions and interpolated band structure output in a variety of file formats for visualisation. Running time: Test cases take 1 minute. References: [1] N. Marzari, D.

   abstract = {Strong electronic correlations are often associated with the proximity of a Mott-insulating state. In recent years however, it has become increasingly clear that the Hund's rule coupling (intra-atomic exchange) is responsible for strong correlations in multiorbital metallic materials that are not close to a Mott insulator. Hund's coupling has two effects: It influences the energetics of the Mott gap and strongly suppresses the coherence scale for the formation of a Fermi liquid. A global picture has emerged recently, which emphasizes the importance of the average occupancy of the shell as a control parameter. The most dramatic effects occur away from half-filling or single occupancy. We review the theoretical understanding and physical properties of these Hund's metals, together with the relevance of this concept to transition-metal oxides (TMOs) of the 3d, and especially 4d, series (such as ruthenates), as well as to the iron-based superconductors (iron pnictides and chalcogenides). © 2013 by Annual Reviews.

Often, the relative d-p orbital splitting has to be adjusted 'ad hoc' on the basis of the experimental evidence. By applying the merger of local density approximation and dynamical mean field theory to the prototypical case of the three-band Emery dp model for the cuprates, we demonstrate that, without any 'ad hoc' adjustment of the orbital splitting, the charge transfer insulating state is stabilized by the interatomic interaction .
